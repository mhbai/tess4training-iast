Akalaṅka defeated the Bauddhas at

Kāñcī in A.D. 855.

Epi. Car. II. p. 84: “ Akalaṅka-

carita, a small Skt. work, gives Vik.

According to Nemidatta’s Ārādhanā-

kathākośa, Akalaṅka was the son of

Puruṣottama, a Brahmin minister of

King Śubhatuṅga of Mānyakheṭa.

and Himaśītala. Here father given as

an Arhaddvija and brother Niṣkalaṅka;
